Indoor digital twin solution based on 3D camera

By projecting texture mapping, video images can be integrated into virtual 3D scenes, which can achieve good visualization effects. However, due to the fixed camera angle used to capture video images in real scenes, and the arbitrary movement of the user's viewing angle when browsing virtual 3D scenes, the video texture rendered on the surface of the 3D model may experience stretching and other deformations when switching scenes, affecting the visualization effect.
